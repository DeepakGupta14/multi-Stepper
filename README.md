# I make my first React App
It is a multi-stepper form react app.
In this project i used a react hook(useState) with bootstrap css file. 

## How to see UI

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Thank you.
